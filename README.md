## Getting Started

### Installation
To install EvanPythonSQLTool, use pip:
```bash
pip install evanpythonsqltool
```


## Usage 

```python
import evanpythonsqltool as epst

# Connect to a database
db_connection = epst.connect_to_db('database_url')

# Fetch data
data = epst.fetch_data(db_connection, 'SELECT * FROM table_name')

# Analyze data
results = epst.analyze_experiment(data, method='t-test')

# Build insights
insights = epst.build_insights(data)

# Standardize analyses
standard_analysis = epst.standard_analysis(data)

```
